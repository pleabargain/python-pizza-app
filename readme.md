# motivation
Everyone else is building one, so why don't I?

And, I was just telling a .jr dev that he should remember the business owner of the pizza joint: reporting on income, pizzas made, etc. Not just the pretty front end. Now I'm knee deep in the problem without much of a plan!

# install

I set up a venv for VS Code

pip install -r requirements.txt

Don't rush, think through the problems!

* I built the order schema before I built the endpoint and I was surprised when I discovered that there was no endpoint!
---



# problems:
* db creation
* endpoints talking to database
* database duplicate entries
* permissions for viewing what parts of the systems! (complex logic there)

# users should be able to
* create a user
* create a pizza order

# manager should be able to 
* create a new pizza offer
* how many pizzas were ordered


# owner  should be able to see 
* how much money was made from orders

# trying to use GPT4 and copilot to build this app

not easy

* GPT4 output is limited

* copilot code awareness is limited e.g. I can't tell copilot to look at the my whole code base. Hell, it's only aware of the file I've selecte!
